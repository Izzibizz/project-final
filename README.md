# Final project

This is the final project of our Web Development Bootcamp at Technigo.
We created an e-commerce website for skincare products. The special thing about our app is that users can specify their allergies and preferences. This way you get recommended products that suit you.
We worked in a group of three people and realised this project in 3 to 4 weeks, including planning and testing.

## The problem

We started planning in Figma for the design and in Notion for the tasks. In the first week we worked separately in backend, frontend and Figma. From the second week onwards, we brought everything together. In the end, it was mainly about fixing bugs and testing everything. We will continue to work on this project and add more things in the coming months.
